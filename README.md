```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash

```

2. Open Terminal
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script
4. Run the script:

./import.zsh
```
5. Launch Orion RC Browser to see your imported data

## What to Expect

5. Show progress with color-coded status messages

## Troubleshooting

### Existing Orion RC Installation

When running the script, if an existing Orion RC directory is detected, you'll be presented with three options:

1. **Backup existing data and continue**
   - Creates a timestamped backup of your current Orion RC data
   - Backup will be stored as `Orion RC_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
   - Proceeds with migration
   - Safest option if you want to keep your existing data

2. **Remove existing data and continue**
   - Deletes all existing Orion RC data
   - Proceeds with fresh migration
   - Use this if you want a clean migration

3. **Exit**
   - Cancels the migration
   - No changes are made to your system
   - Use this if you need to backup data manually

To manually handle existing data:
```bash
# Backup existing data
mv "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Orion RC" "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Orion RC_backup"

# Or remove existing data
rm -rf "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Orion RC"
```

**Note:** If you experience issues after migration, you can restore your backup by reversing the backup process:
```bash
rm -rf "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Orion RC"
mv "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Orion RC_backup" "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Orion RC"
```

### Extensions Not Showing Up
- Make sure both browsers are completely closed before running the script
- Launch Orion RC and check the extensions page
- You might need to re-enable some extensions manually

### Profile Data Missing
- Verify that you've launched both browsers at least once before migration
- Check if the source directory exists: `~/Library/Application Support/Orion`
- Ensure you have read permissions on the source directory

### Script Permission Denied
```bash
chmod +x import.zsh
```

## Directory Structure

The script works with the following directory structure:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Orion/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [UUID] (Profile Directory)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extensions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extension State/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other profile data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Defaults/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebApps/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other browser data)
```
